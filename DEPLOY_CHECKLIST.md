- [x] `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive deployment instructions

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy to Netlify

Your frontend is now ready for Netlify deployment! Follow these steps:

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Netlify deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Select your repository
5. Use these build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build:frontend`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist/public`

### 3. Your Frontend Will Be Live!
- You'll get a URL like `https://your-app.netlify.app`
- The frontend will work, but API calls won't work until you deploy the backend

## 🔧 Next Steps - Deploy Backend

Your backend needs to be deployed separately. Recommended options:

### Railway (Easiest)
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect GitHub and select your repo
3. Add environment variables from `.env.example`
4. Deploy automatically!

### After Backend is Deployed
1. Get your backend URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
2. In Netlify dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add: `VITE_API_URL=https://your-app.railway.app`
4. Redeploy your Netlify site (will happen automatically)

## 🔍 Testing Your Deployment

1. **Frontend only**: Check if the site loads and navigation works
2. **With backend**: Test login, creating projects, AI features
3. **Check console**: Look for any errors in browser dev tools

## ❗ Important Notes

- Environment variables starting with `VITE_` are the only ones available in frontend
- Your `.env` file is not deployed (secrets stay secret!)
- CORS must be configured on backend to accept requests from Netlify domain
- Database should be a production PostgreSQL instance
